# hello-world

out-liar consulting is learning how to use github in this repository.

I'm a coder wannabe, learning Python on codeacdemy with the aim to tranistion to Github and work on projects that will demonstrate my data science skills to employers and consulting clients so that I can work on interesting projects.

Eventually I want to use data analysis and visualisation to make humanitarian arguments, most likely in the context of data the government publish. I was inspired to do this by a TED Talk in which a guy visualised water quality in the New York area and iodentified quick wins for the local authorities to improve water quality.
